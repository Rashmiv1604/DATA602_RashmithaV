I am very much interested to take up DATA602-Principles of Data Science because I want to deepen my skills in python and also to apply various techniques to develop the solutions for the given data. Also, I am interested to work on different data science tools like jupyter, colab, mysql etc. and build meaningful insights for the given data. Personally, I want to develop a project in finance using these skills so that it can perfectly align with my long term goals.
